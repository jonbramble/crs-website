***What previous participants have said about Springboard:***

Springboard gave me that extra push I needed to achieve more, say more and
have more confidence in myself.

Springboard provided me with a structure within which to face issues which
I would probably have avoided thinking about otherwise. I feel much more
confident and clearer about my own values and aims.

This programme offers a revolutionary opportunity to get out of the rut. It
shows you what you have suspected and chosen to ignore- that it is up to
you. The fence became uncomfortable.

I can honestly say that it makes a lot of sense, has definitely changed my
life tremendously, and is still doing so.

A must do event, enlightening for women everywhere, of all ages, at any
stage in their personal and professional life. I have emerged renewed and
confident to face challenges and change with enthusiasm and clear
direction.

For any additional information, please get in touch.

Best wishes.

Sandrine
