  <p>As a new researcher in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Sheffield it’s important to make use of the excellent selection of courses and support that the University has to offer. Becoming a well-rounded researcher isn’t just about achieving your research goals (although these are very important) it’s also about becoming involved in the running of your department, writing papers, formulating grants and fellowships, building networks and supervising students.  This is where your Chemistry Researcher Society can help. We organise regular coffee mornings to allow research staff to get together and chat about issues affecting you and others in the department. We can give advice and assistance on how to take advantage of everything the University has to offer, and on the issues that affect you. By coming together we can form a departmental network for collaboration and support which benefits us all.<p>
